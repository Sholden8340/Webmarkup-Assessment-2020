                    A solar charger gathers energy from your solar panels, and stores it in your batteries.
                    Using the latest, fastest technology, SmartSolar maximises this energy-harvest, driving it
                    intelligently to achieve full charge in the shortest possible time.
                    SmartSolar maintains battery health, extending its life.
                    <strong>The SmartSolar charge controller</strong> will even recharge a severely depleted battery.
                    It can operate with a battery voltage as low as <em>0 Volts</em>, provided the cells are not
                    permanently sulphated or otherwise damaged.

                    Solar charge controllers <strong>Steca Solarix 2525 and 4040</strong> are newly developed products
                    based on
                    the internationally renowned controller family Steca PR.
                    With increased module and load current, the controllers are now also suitable for even
                    larger systems.
                    The devices also feature an <em>integrated USB charging port</em> for charging smartphones and
                    tablets.
                    Use of the latest charging technologies combined with state of charge determination enable
                    optimal battery maintenance and module power monitoring.
                    A large display informs the user about all operating modes with the aid of symbols.
                    The state of charge is represented visually as a level meter. Data such as voltage, current
                    and state of charge can also be displayed digitally as figures on the display.
                    In addition, the controller has an energy meter which can be reset by the user.

            <h4>5 Reasons to Use Solar Power</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Solar Power Is Good for the Environment</h3>
                    Solar power is self-sufficient and installing solar panels on your roof is a safe and easy path
                    to contribute
                    to a sustainable future.
                    Starting on your home is a great way to show you care about the environment.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Solar Electricity Makes Your Home Go Off-the-Grid</h3>
                    Solar electricity boosts your electricity independence! By investing in a 4kW solar system,
                    which is the most common domestic size, you can easily protect yourself against unpredictable
                    increases in utility prices, and enjoy cheap electricity throughout the entire day - the sun
                    will never increase its rates and it gives you energy security.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Solar Power Can Use Underutilised Land</h3>
                    You might have heard of solar farms - panels used to harvest solar energy in large numbers. This
                    highlights perfectly how solar power makes use of underutilised land. For instance, a 45 acre
                    solar farm has been recently built in the UK, and it’s able to power 2,500 homes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Solar Power Causes Less Electricity Loss</h3>
                    Rooftop solar power is helpful in increasing electricity efficiency, considering the short
                    distance. Your energy becomes domestic and as a result you’re in control of your own bills and
                    energy usage. Furthermore, solar power systems are durable, thus chances of service interruption
                    are reduced.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Solar Power Is A Free Source of Energy</h3>
                    When there are many of us switching to solar power, we are less likely to experience blackouts
                    or brownouts. Every household in the UK that have solar cells installed, functions as a small
                    power plant. This, in turn, provides us with a greater electricity grid security, especially in
                    terms of natural or human-caused disasters.
